# Storytime Bard
The goal of Storytime Bard is to make it easy to generate children stories from basic prompts, using parameters on the children's age, interests, and learning factors. Over time, a child's "library" could grow, in that a single story could be created and then subsequent stories could be added to it. It would be ideal for children to have siblings, cousins, and friends that stories could be shared with or added to.

## The basic flow
0. A parent, guardian, teacher, or loved one (USER) creates an account with email and password, magic link, or Google.
1. USER logs in.
2. They add all their children, their ages, their interests, etc. 
3. They then select a story prompt, and how long their story should be.
4. They then select a set of parameters for the story
5. The story is generated. They can make changes to it, save it, ore remix it. The story should use the TipTap editor for writing.
6. They can then share it with a friend or family member.

### Additional future features
- Record your voice, then have the story read it back to you. Change accents, etc.
- Share the story as an mp3 link. 
- Generate PDFs of the story
- Dynamically generate pictures for the story based on the output.
- A USER receives new stories automatically in their inbox.
